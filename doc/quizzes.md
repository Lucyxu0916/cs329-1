# Quizzes

## Quiz 1

### Regular Expressions

* Create [`regular_expressions.py`](../src/regular_expressions.py) under the [`src/`](../src) directory and copy the contents.
* Complete the `turn_1b()` method such that it prompts to ask the kind of user's smartphone if it is not provided during `Turn 0`.
Once the information is retrieved, it should continue to `turn_1a()` as follows: 
  ```
  S: are you using a smartphone?
  U: yes
  S: what kind of smartphone do you have?
  U: samsung galaxy
  S: how long have you been using galaxy?
  ...
  ``` 
* Complete the `turn_3a()` method such that it properly estimates how old user's iPhone is given any version provided by the user.
Hint: use `res.d_iphone_v` defined in the main space.

### Submission

* Commit and push `src/regular_expression.py` to your GitHub repository.
* Submit `regular_expression.py` to https://canvas.emory.edu/courses/71182/assignments/294356


## Quiz 2

### Ontology and Taxonomy

* Create [`state_machine.py`](../src/state_machine.py) under the [`src/`](../src) directory and copy the contents.
* Set up the appropriate transitions between state `U0` and state `S1a` such that it follows the middle branch of the state machine diagram shown in [`dialogue_management.ipynb`](../src/state_machine.py), except it transitions from `U1b` to `S1a` instead of from `U1b` to `end` (similar to the first task of Quiz 1). An example of a dialogue it should be capable of handling should look like this: 
  ```
  S: are you using a smartphone?
  U: yes
  S: what kind of smartphone do you have?
  U: samsung galaxy
  S: how long have you been using galaxy?
  ...
  ```
